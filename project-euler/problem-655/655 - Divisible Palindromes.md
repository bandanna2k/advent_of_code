# Divisible Palindromes (Problem 655)

The numbers 545, 5995, and 15151 are the three smallest palindromes divisible by 109. 
There are nine palindromes less than 100,000 which are divisible by 109.

How many palindromes less than 10^32 are divisible by 10,000,019?

## Notes

less than (10^32)
99999999999999999999999999999999 = 32 chars

1 char              = 9 palindrome
2 char              = 9
3 char              = ?
4 char              = ?
...
32 chars            = 10^31 palindromes
